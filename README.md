# Twitter Sentiment

This is a small PHP project. There are several PHP scripts available for use on the command line (`php -f <file>`).

`getTweets.php` should be executed first. This will retrieve some tweets from the Twitter API. Any other script can then be run.

You will need some API keys from twitter, these can be entered in `getTweets.php`.
